# Installation Instructions

## ✅ TypeScript Errors Fixed!

All source code type errors have been resolved. The remaining errors are just missing dependencies.

## 🚀 Next Step: Install Dependencies

Run this command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages:
- React & React DOM
- TypeScript types
- Zustand (state management)  
- React Router DOM
- Radix UI components
- Tailwind CSS
- And all other dependencies

## ⏱️ Installation Time
The installation should take 2-3 minutes depending on your internet connection.

## 🎯 After Installation

Once `npm install` completes, all errors will be resolved and you can start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

**Note:** The CSS warnings about `@tailwind` and `@apply` are normal - they're Tailwind directives that work perfectly at runtime.
